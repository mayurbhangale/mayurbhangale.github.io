I'm a software engineer at [Zomato](https://zomato.com){:target="\_blank"} working on problems in NLP, Search, Ranking and their intersection.
Prior to Zomato, I was Data Scientist at [Crysagi Systems (acquired by CoreView Systems)](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/coreview-acquires-crysagi-systems-119081400734_1.html) where I spent my time applying cutting edge deep learning research to solve business problems in areas ranging from knowledge graphs, NLP to geometric deep learning.

Before Crysagi, I worked as tech lead (founding team) at StoreKey where I learned about Indian internet market, product management and [doing hard things](https://www.amazon.in/Hard-Thing-about-Building-Business/dp/0062273205).
